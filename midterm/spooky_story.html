<p style="font-size: 18px;"></p>On Halloween night, Eastbrook High was already giving off strange vibes. LeBron James was helping set up in the gym when he noticed something weird: basketballs were bouncing on their own, one after another. At first, he thought it was a prank, but they kept spinning in slow, eerie circles. Meanwhile, Elmo had agreed to roam the school in his bright red fur, planning to bring a little cheer to the kids. But as he walked down the dim halls, he started to feel like he was being watched. He heard faint, childlike whispers echoing down the hallway, though no one was there. KSI, the guest speaker for the night, was spooked too—he felt a sudden chill as he waited in the empty auditorium, then saw the lights flicker and heard faint footsteps backstage, as if someone, or something, was lurking.</p>
<p> Startled, he left the stage and ran into LeBron and Elmo, who looked just as uneasy. “Anyone else getting creepy vibes tonight?” KSI asked, glancing around. LeBron nodded. “Yeah, man. Something’s definitely off.” Suddenly, the gym doors creaked open as if inviting them inside. They entered slowly, only for the doors to slam shut behind them. The gym was dead silent—until the bleachers started to shift, as though invisible people were sitting down to watch. The walls darkened, shadows stretched, and hollow-eyed faces appeared, staring silently at them. The basketballs on the court began bouncing faster and faster, spinning in a chaotic blur as the faces seemed to whisper their names. Elmo clutched LeBron’s arm, shaking, while KSI muttered, “Nah, we’re not sticking around for this.” They bolted for the locker rooms, aiming for the back exit, as chilling laughter filled the air. Finally, they burst out into the cold night, gasping for breath. When they turned back, the gym stood silent and dark, as if nothing had happened. But the next morning, the janitor found clawed footprints trailing across the gym floor, fading into the shadows, as though whatever had haunted Eastbrook High had slipped back into the night</p>
